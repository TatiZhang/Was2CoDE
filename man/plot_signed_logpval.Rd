\usage{
plot_signed_logpval(
  df,
  method1,
  method2,
  bool_capped = TRUE,
  bool_multtestadjust = TRUE,
  highlight_features = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing gene names and results from two methods.
Must contain columns: Feature, method1_logFC, method1_pval, method2_logFC, method2_pval
where method1 and method2 are replaced with the actual method names.}

\item{method1}{Character string specifying the name of the first method.
Used to construct column names (e.g., "DESeq2" looks for "DESeq2_logFC" and "DESeq2_pval").}

\item{method2}{Character string specifying the name of the second method.
Used to construct column names (e.g., "edgeR" looks for "edgeR_logFC" and "edgeR_pval").}

\item{bool_capped}{Logical indicating whether to cap extreme values. Currently unused
but values are automatically capped at 97.5\% quantile for visualization.}

\item{bool_multtestadjust}{Logical indicating whether the draw the dotted lines at the nominal or
multiple-test-corrected pvalues (default).}

\item{highlight_features}{Character vector of gene names to highlight in red.
If NULL (default), genes significant in both methods (FDR < 0.05) will be highlighted.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the comparison plot with:
\itemize{
\item Purple shaded regions indicating significance in both methods
\item Dashed lines showing FDR cutoffs
\item Coral line showing the first principal component
\item Red points and labels for highlighted genes
\item Correlation and Fisher test results in the title
}
}
\description{
Creates a scatter plot comparing signed log p-values between two differential
expression methods/datasets, with optional highlighting of specific genes or pathways.
The signed log p-value is calculated as sign(logFC) * -log10(p-value), which
allows visualization of both significance and direction of change.
